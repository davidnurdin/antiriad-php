## This game

Started from the JumPHP skeleton (a small platformer). Update this section as the game grows:

- **What it is**: ...
- **Scenes**: `TitleScene` (menu) → `PlayScene` (level) ; overlays `PauseScene` ; `OptionsScene` (pushed).
- **Entities**: `Player` (Sprite + Gravity + TileCollision), `Coin`.
- **Controls** (`config/input.yaml`): arrows / WASD move, Space jumps, Escape pauses.
- **Smoke test** (`config/game.yaml` smoke): `PlayScene` with `demo: true` (a bot runs and jumps).
- **Non-obvious**: the tileset is drawn with GD in `PlayScene::makeTileset()`; replace it with a PNG
  (`assets/tiles/`) or a Tiled map (`TiledJsonLoader`).

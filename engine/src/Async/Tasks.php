 * Background work for games, three backends behind one API (backend()):
 * - 'threads': real OS threads with the "async" runtime (PHP 8.6 ZTS + TrueAsync, game.yaml `runtime: async`);
 * - 'workers': in the browser, a pool of Web Workers each running its own PHP engine (WebWorkers);
 * - 'frames': elsewhere (PHP 8.3 desktop), the work runs on the main thread between frames, a few
 *   milliseconds per frame ($budget), so the game keeps moving.
 *
 *   $tasks = $this->engine->tasks();
 *   $task = $tasks->thread(static fn () => heavy($data));        // one thread for one job
 *   $pool = $tasks->pool(4);                                      // N workers, many jobs
 *   $jobs = array_map(fn ($row) => $pool->submit(static fn (int $y) => render_row($y), $row), range(0, 179));
 *   ... each frame: if ($task->isDone()) ...  (the engine polls them before the scenes update)
 *
 * What runs in a thread is a COPY: a separate PHP world with the game's autoloader (vendor/autoload.php), no
 * engine, no SDL, no scene. Give it plain values (numbers, strings, arrays, simple objects) and use `static fn`
 * (a closure using $this would try to copy the scene). It returns plain values too. No references, no
 * resources (files, textures, sounds).
